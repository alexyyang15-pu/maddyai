# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Product Name:** Maddy AI

## **Version:** 0.2

## **Owner:** Product / Founders

## **Document Status:** Draft

# **1. Overview**

## **1.1 Product Summary**

Maddy AI is a relationship-intelligence OS for founders, investors, operators, and community builders who manage large, chaotic networks but lack tools to keep relationships warm. Unlike Happenstance or traditional CRMs, Maddy AI is not a people-search engine — it is a **personal relationship assistant** that centralizes contacts, enriches them, tracks warmth, and enables agentic workflows for follow-ups, introductions, and contextual outreach.

The system combines contact ingestion, AI enrichment, natural-language search, relationship scoring, and proactive nudges to help users maintain meaningful relationships at scale.

# **2. Problem Statement**

Super-connectors frequently experience:

* Contacts scattered across Gmail, LinkedIn, calendars, social platforms, spreadsheets, and notes
* Poor recall of who’s important, who they met recently, and who needs a follow-up
* Difficulty identifying who to meet when traveling or attending conferences
* Missed opportunities for intros or collaboration
* Manual, repetitive outreach workflows
* Tools that feel transactional or CRM-ish rather than personal and warm

Maddy AI solves these by becoming the “second brain” for a user’s network.

# **3. Goals & Non-Goals**

## **3.1 Goals**

* Consolidate the user’s entire network into one enriched, deduped system
* Make all contacts queryable using natural language
* Provide warm, tailored nudges to maintain relationships
* Suggest relevant intros, follow-ups, meeting opportunities, and co-investors
* Build agentic workflows to draft communications and manage orchestrated outreach
* Feel personal, human, and supportive — not spammy

## **3.2 Non-Goals**

* Becoming a public social network
* Fully automated sending of emails/DMs without user approval
* High-pressure sales or CRM features
* Ranking people by clout or social metrics

---

# **4. User Personas**

## **4.1 Primary: The Super-Connector Investor (“Chanmeet”)**

* Meets dozens of people weekly
* Travels frequently
* Needs consistent follow-ups and networking prep
* Wants scalable warmth, not spam

## **4.2 Secondary: Founders / Operators**

* Hiring, fundraising, BD
* Need organized awareness of their network
* Want fast recall of who to contact

## **4.3 Secondary: Creators / Community Builders**

* Need connection intelligence and warm intros

---

# **5. Key Use Cases**

1. **Post-event follow-up workflow**
   “Who did I meet today and who should I follow up with?”
2. **Travel-based networking suggestions**
   “I’m in NYC next week — who should I grab coffee with?”
3. **Deal collaboration**
   “Who are good co-investors I know for a pre-seed fintech round?”
4. **Warmth maintenance**
   “Notify me when 60 days go by with no interaction with a top contact.”
5. **Contextual message drafting**
   “Draft a follow-up email to this person summarizing our meeting.”

# **6. Core Features**

## **6.1 Unified Contact Ingestion (Updated)**

### **6.1.1 Gmail Ingestion**

#### **Approach Overview**

Use official **Google Identity Services** with OAuth2 to ingest contacts, interaction metadata, and email signatures.

#### **Scopes Required**

* `gmail.readonly`
* `userinfo.email` (optional)
* `userinfo.profile` (optional)

#### **Data Extracted**

* **Email headers** (From/To/CC) → primary contact discovery
* **Timestamped conversation history** → warmth engine input
* **Signature block parsing** → titles, companies, social links
* **Thread-level metadata** → counting replies, size, recency
* **Meeting detection** from email context (if user opts in)

#### **Processing**

* Normalize all extracted emails into a **Unified Contact Profile**
* Deduplicate using:

  * Exact address
  * Name similarity
  * Company/domain context
* Summarize recent email bodies into embeddings without storing raw text
* Generate relationship embeddings (“context vectors”)

#### **Privacy**

* Raw email bodies **never stored** unless user explicitly toggles on
* Full deletion possible at any time

---

### **6.1.2 LinkedIn Ingestion**

#### **Overview**

Due to LinkedIn API restrictions, ingestion is built as a **multi-tier strategy**.

### **Tier 1 (MVP): User-Uploaded LinkedIn Export**

Users upload their official LinkedIn data export (CSV/JSON).
Provides:

* Full list of 1st-degree connections
* Roles, companies, education
* Profile metadata

**Processing Steps:**

* Parse “Connections.csv” → contact list
* Parse “Profile.json” → work/education timeline
* Enrich contacts via embeddings (expertise, industry, seniority)
* Match LinkedIn contacts to Gmail contacts via fuzzy matching

### **Tier 2: Chrome Extension (Midterm)**

For user-initiated profile capture:

* On profile page → user clicks “Add to Maddy”
* Extension extracts structured fields:

  * Name
  * Headline
  * Experience list
  * Location
  * Summary/About text
* User permission required for each capture

### **Tier 3: Official LinkedIn API Partner Access (Long-Term)**

* Would allow live syncing of connections
* Requires LinkedIn partnership
* 6–12 month horizon

---

### **6.2 AI Enrichment**

* Auto-detect job roles, industries, seniority, investment stage, geographic relevance
* Create confidence scores for each dimension
* Build semantic vectors for:

  * Expertise
  * Relationship strength
  * Shared relevance to user’s goals

---

### **6.3 Natural Language Search**

Query examples:

* “Show me all healthtech founders in SF I haven’t spoken to since July.”
* “Find my strongest connectors in AI.”
* “Who should I meet at Consensus next month?”

Search supports:

* Filtering
* Ranking by warmth
* Relevance scoring
* Custom user preferences (“always prioritize early-stage investors”)

---

### **6.4 Warmth Engine + Nudges**

Triggers include:

* Time-based decay (30/60/90 days)
* Contact role changes (new job → congratulate?)
* Contact location + user travel coincidence
* Recent email silence after meetings
* Contact anniversaries or milestones

Modal examples:

* “It’s been 45 days since you last spoke with Maya — keep warm?”
* “Alex just became a Partner at XYZ — draft congrats?”

---

### **6.5 Priority Modeling**

Signals include:

* Messaging frequency
* Email depth/recurrence
* User manually pinning or marking important
* User queries
* Past successful intros

Model output:

* Priority index (0–100)
* “Top Circle” automated suggestions

---

### **6.6 Agentic Workflows**

Workflows are always **user-approved**, not auto-sent.

Examples:

* Draft follow-up emails after events
* Draft LinkedIn connection requests
* Suggest intros + write intro emails
* Prepare “people to meet” lists before travel
* Generate group intro scripts

---

### **6.7 Event & Conference Mode**

If user imports calendar or emails:

* Extract attendee names
* Identify new connections
* Produce prioritized follow-up list
* Draft emails in bulk with contextual summaries

---

# **7. UX / UI Principles**
